    <h1>This paragraph is about 5G technology</h1>
    <p>In telecommunications, 5G is the fifth-generation technology standard for cellular networks, 
        which cellular phone companies began deploying worldwide in 2019, 
        and is the successor to 4G technology that provides connectivity to most current mobile phones.
        Like its predecessors, 5G networks are cellular networks, 
        in which the service area is divided into small geographical areas called cells. 
        All 5G wireless devices in a cell are connected to the Internet and the telephone network by radio waves through a basestation and antennae in the cell.
        The new networks have higher download speeds, with a peak speed of 10 gigabits per second (Gbit/s) when there is only one user in the network.
        5G has higher bandwidth to deliver faster speeds than 4G and can connect more devices, improving the quality of Internet services in crowded areas.
        Due to the increased bandwidth, it is expected the 5G networks will increasingly be used as general internet service providers (ISPs), competing with existing ISPs such as cable internet, and also will make possible new applications in internet-of-things (IoT) and machine-to-machine areas. 
        Cellphones with only 4G capability are not able to use the 5G networks.</p>
